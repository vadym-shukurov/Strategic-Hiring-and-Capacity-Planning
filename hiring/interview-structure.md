# 🔍 The Modern Engineering Interview

I believe in "Low Stress, High Density" interviews. We test for how people think, not what they’ve memorized.

### Stage 1: The Tactical Screen (45m)
* **Focus:** Practical problem solving.
* **Key Question:** "Show me a piece of code you're proud of and explain the trade-offs you made."

### Stage 2: The System Design / Technical Density (60m)
* **Focus:** Architecture and Boundaries.
* **Key Question:** "Design a payment system that handles 10k TPS. How do you ensure idempotency?"

### Stage 3: The "Owner" Mindset (45m)
* **Focus:** Culture-Add and Stewardship.
* **Key Question:** "Tell me about a time you owned a failure. How did you change the process to prevent it from happening again?"

### Stage 4: Executive Alignment (30m)
* **Focus:** Strategic alignment.
* **Key Question:** "How do you balance technical perfection with business deadlines?"
