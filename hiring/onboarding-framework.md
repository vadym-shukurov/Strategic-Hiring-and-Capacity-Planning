# 🚀 Onboarding to Autonomy: The 30-60-90 Day Success Plan

A successful onboarding process is not about "orientation"—it is about **momentum**. My framework is designed to move a new engineer from "Environment Setup" to "Autonomous Stewardship" as quickly and safely as possible.

## 🏁 The "First 24 Hours" Goal: The Quick Win
We measure onboarding success by how quickly a new hire can navigate the "Paved Road."
* **Goal:** Merge a non-trivial documentation or small bug-fix PR by the end of Day 1.
* **Why:** It validates that the local environment, CI/CD permissions, and deployment gates are working as intended.

## 📅 The 30-60-90 Day Roadmap

### Phase 1: The First 30 Days (Learning & Contribution)
* **Focus:** Understanding the Domain Boundaries and the "Engineering OS."
* **Key Activities:** * Complete a "Deep Dive" session on our **System Design Governance**.
    * Shadow an On-Call rotation to understand failure modes.
    * Deliver a minor feature or bug fix within a core service.
* **Outcome:** The engineer can navigate the codebase and understands our **Quality Strategy**.

### Phase 2: The 60-Day Mark (Collaboration & Context)
* **Focus:** Taking ownership of a small sub-domain.
* **Key Activities:** * Author their first **ADR (Architecture Decision Record)** for a small change.
    * Participate in peer PR reviews, focusing on our **Clean Code Standards**.
    * Lead a technical grooming session for a squad epic.
* **Outcome:** The engineer can independently propose and execute technical solutions within an established framework.

### Phase 3: The 90-Day Mark (Full Stewardship)
* **Focus:** Proactive contribution and mentoring.
* **Key Activities:** * Propose an improvement to our **Engineering Standards**.
    * Fully own a feature from design (RFC/ADR) to production monitoring.
    * Act as a "Buddy" for the next new hire.
* **Outcome:** The engineer is a "Culture-Add" who proactively identifies and solves technical debt.

## 🛠️ The Onboarding Toolkit
* **The Onboarding Buddy:** Every hire is paired with a peer (not their manager) to handle day-to-day tactical questions.
* **Self-Service Docs:** A "Read Me First" guide covering local setup, VPNs, and internal tooling links.
* **Weekly Check-ins:** Structured 1-on-1s focused specifically on "What is slowing you down?" to identify friction in our DevEx.
