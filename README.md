# 📈 Strategic Hiring & Capacity Planning
### Scaling Engineering Organizations with ROI-Driven Headcount

This framework defines how I approach building high-performance engineering teams. It moves beyond "filling vacancies" to a data-driven model that balances product roadmap demands, technical debt, and financial sustainability.

## 🏗️ The 3-Pillar Capacity Model

### 1. The 70/20/10 Rule for Resource Allocation
To prevent burnout and architectural decay, I govern squad capacity using a balanced ratio:
* **70% Feature Delivery:** Direct roadmap value and new product development.
* **20% Engineering Excellence:** Refactoring, performance tuning, and paying down technical debt.
* **10% Innovation/Discovery:** Prototyping and R&D to ensure long-term competitiveness.

### 2. Skills-Gap Matrix vs. Headcount
I don't hire for "Software Engineer" in a vacuum. I use a **Skills-Gap Matrix** to identify where the team lacks specific "Technical Density" (e.g., Distributed Systems, Security, or FinOps) and hire specifically to raise the team's average.

### 3. Hiring for "Stewardship"
My hiring process is designed to find "Modern SDETs" and "Product-Minded Engineers." I look for candidates who value **Ownership** over **Task-Completion**.
